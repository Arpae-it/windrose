    shortDescription: >
         A simple and fast Shiny interface written in R that can be used to show some public WMS services along with a minimal set of drawing tools
    longDescription: >
        Mappatore is a simple and fast Shiny interface written in R used mainly to show public WMS services. The simple code is very easily editable to add more WMS services.
        It also allows the user to upload a kml file and plot it along with the already shown WMS layers.
        The main use is to provide a very fast and simple small online GIS that can also be used in the field by all the operators
        who need a map on the fly with different reference layers.
        It also provides a very simple way to translate coordinates from geographical (WGS84) to UTM32.
        When used in the field from a smartphone or tablet it automatically brings the user to his/her position and it can be used to reverse georeference any point on the fly.
        An implementation of it is available freely at:
        https://arpae.shinyapps.io/mappatore/
        
    features:
       - Show different WMS services at the same time
       - Convert coordinates between WGS84 and UTM32
       - Draw polygons and lines and make measures
       - Reverse georeferencing
